    to help other *mm projects build with C++11 or C++14 compiler support.

    be copied into projects manually.

  of glibmm-2.4 to get the location of doctool .pl files, such
  as doc-install.pl.
  * MM_CONFIG_DOCTOOL_DIR(): Get the .pl files from mm-common's
  installed copy instead of from glibmm, which now doesn't install its own
  copy. Because this macro has been updated, there should be no need for
  any changes in other *mm modules due to the changes in glibmm or mm-common.
  * Allow use of GMMPROC_EXTRA_M4_DIR in configure.ac to tell gmmproc about
  extra -I arguments.
  For instance, use this in configure.ac:
  MM_PKG_CONFIG_SUBST([GMMPROC_EXTRA_M4_DIR], [--variable=gmmprocm4dir gtkmm-3.0])

	The Invisible Book of Invisibility.

	  mechanism has been removed from the skeleton project.

	  to produce a hierarchy of class chapters grouped by scope.
	* The documentation build rules can now be included from the
	  top-level, without recursion into a sub-directory.

	  to facilitate building with explicit symbol visibility.

	  documentation groups as C++ namespaces.  Also, documentation
	  modules are now listed as book chapters.

	  properly with the new XHTML output of Doxygen.

mm-common 0.7.1 "Lenience" (2009-08-28)

	Be a bit less unfashionably draconian.

	* It is no longer a hard error to build a package based on

	Document with style, using the new shared Doxygen style sheet.

	  on library.gnome.org.

mm-common 0.6 "Slash" (2009-08-24)

	To slash or not to slash? This release is all about slashes.

	* The external documentation magic now pleases both Doxygen
	  and doc-install.pl: no more double slashes or accidentally
	  concatenated words.

	  XML and HTML documentation output.
	* The documentation generation is disabled automatically if the
	  utilities required to build it are missing at configure time.
